#1.	Fit a model with all predictors, show the summary and comment on the results.The most significant predictors of CHD from this model are age, typea, ldl and tobacco, they all have low p-values which have been deemed significant from the summary.With these small p-values for the listed significant predictors, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis â€˜that CHD prediction is the same among the different predictor variables'.

par(mfrow=c(1,8)) # puts all eight plots side-by-side

#2.	Use the step command in R to reduce your model, show the summary of this model and comment on the results. The new model is: glm(formula = chd ~ tobacco + ldl + adiposity + typea + obesity + alcohol + age + adiposity:alcohol + typea:alcohol + adiposity:obesity + tobacco:ldl, family = binomial, data = heart). The significant predictor variables are now, tobacco, ldl, typea, obesity, alcohol, age, adiposity:alcohol and typea:alcohol. With the nost significant predictors being ldl,typea and age. 
heart.mod2<-step(heart.mod,scope=~.^2)
heart.mod2
summary(heart.mod2)

#3.	Use the anova command in R to compare your two models.Is there evidence that the larger model is preferred over the reduced model? My larger model is model 2 and my smaller modle is model 1. The deviance drops a bit from model 2(first model) to model 1(larger model), devianace decreases by 15 with the larger model. The p-vaule is small with the larger model, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis â€˜that the coefficient of CHD prediction is zero among the different predictor variables'. We do need to include the variables of the larger model (model 2).
