SIMULATED DATA FOR THESIS RACETRACK LABORATORY EXPERIMENT


> Simulated Substrate Speed Data: average speeds for 25 lizards running on each 
substrate (sand & debris)
>> A sample size of 25 was chosen based off of my power analysis, which told me 
I would need a minimum of 10 lizards and could go up to possibly 30 lizards. 
Therefore I chose a sample size between 10 and 30, but closer to 30 to reduce 
potential for error or skewed data.
```{r}
# Sand Running Times
sand_sim <- runif(25, 1, 3)  #creating sand simulated data
sand_sim_rnd <- signif(sand_sim, digits = 3)  #rounding digits
sand_speed <- data.frame(sand_sim_rnd)  #creating data frame of sand speeds
```


```{r}
# Debris Running Times
debris_sim <- runif(25, 1, 3)   #creating simulated debris data
debris_sim_rnd <- signif(debris_sim, digits = 3)   #rounding digits
debris_speed <- data.frame(debris_sim_rnd)   #creating data frame of debris speeds
```


```{r}
# Viewing the simulated data: boxplot showing the distribution of lizard speeds 
# on sand and debris
boxplot(sand_sim_rnd, debris_sim_rnd, names = c("Sand", "Debris"), 
        main = "Simulated Speed Times", xlab = "Substrate Type", ylab = "Speed (sec)")
```


```{r}
# Simulating choice experiment: 0 = sand, 1 = debris 
# (lizards have the option to choose which substrate to run on, sand or debris)
choice_sim_data <- sample(0:1, 25, replace = TRUE)
choice_data <- data.frame(choice_sim_data)
```

lizard_ID <- data.frame(lizard_ID_i)   
```


```{r}
# Creating a data frame with lizard IDs and running data of sand and debris

sand_range <- max(sand_sim_rnd) - min(sand_sim_rnd)  #range of sand runs

```{r}

# sand ("0") or debris ("1")

> Writing Linear Models

>> Sand Linear Model
```{r}
# sand linear model without categorical variables
sand_lm <- lm(sand_sim_rnd ~ body_mass_rnd * SVL_rnd * tail_length_rnd, 
              data = racetrack_df)

# No variables appear to be signficant
```

# When I added in both sex and age the model returned mostly NAs, so I decided 
# to run the model without both categorical variables and then I added them back  
# in one at a time.

> Based off of the linear models, no physical characteristics of the lizards 
were significant in affecting their speed on either sand or debris. This is not 
to say that when I get actual speed and physical attribute data from my 
experiment that the same results will not happen, but it could. None of the 
linear models fit the data particularly well, but the linear model that fit the 
best for sand was the one that included sex as a variables; the linear model 
that fit debris the best was the one that included age as a variable.
