> Tried a couple of different effect sizes (d). An effect of 0.5 (50%) gave a 
sample size of 3, which seemed very small. An effect size of 0.1 (10%) gave a 
sample size of 32. An effect size of 0.15 (15%) gave a sample size of 15. These 
different effect sizes show me that I would like a sample size of at least 10, 
and up to possibly 30, depending on how variable the lizards are running on the 
substrates. 
> I changed the significance level and power level in the power analyses above
to get a broader sense of what type of sample size I would need depending on 
how rigorous I wanted my analysis to be. The lower the significance level and 
the higher the power, the greater sample size required.
